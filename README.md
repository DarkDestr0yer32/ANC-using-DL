## üîç Introduction  
Noise cancellation is essential in fields like **telecommunications, media production, and assistive technology**. Traditional methods like spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering often fail in **non-stationary noise conditions**. This project employs a deep learning-based **Conv1D-LSTM model** to reconstruct cleaner audio signals.  

## üìÇ Dataset  
We utilize the **Microsoft Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) dataset**, which consists of **paired noisy and clean audio samples**. The dataset provides diverse real-world noise conditions, making it suitable for training deep learning models.  

## üõ† Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Convert raw audio into **Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** for efficient feature extraction.  
2. **Model Selection:** Employ a **Conv1D-LSTM hybrid model** for spatial and temporal feature extraction.  
3. **Training & Validation:** Monitor metrics such as **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to evaluate model performance.  
4. **Testing & Evaluation:** Compare reconstructed clean audio with ground truth to assess noise suppression effectiveness.  

## üèó Model Architecture  
The model follows a hybrid **Conv1D-LSTM** structure:  
- **Conv1D Layers:** Extract spectral features.  
- **Max Pooling:** Reduce dimensionality and retain crucial information.  
- **LSTM Layers:** Capture sequential patterns in audio data.  
- **Dense Layers:** Process extracted features and reconstruct clean audio.  

## üìä Results  
- **Low MAE and RMSE scores**, indicating strong performance.  
- **Visual waveform comparisons** demonstrate clear noise suppression.  
- Model outperforms traditional techniques in **non-stationary noise environments**.  

## üöÄ Challenges & Future Work  
### Challenges:  
- Model may **overfit on specific noise types**.  
- High-noise conditions may still degrade performance.  

### Future Enhancements:  
- Explore **transformer-based models** for better noise suppression.  
- Implement real-time processing for **streaming applications**.
